            <p>NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are intended to be unique digital identifiers; a kind of “uncompromisable digital record”. They are not in fact anything like this, but this is what they claim to be.</p>
       </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            <p>The main uses for them so far has been to make digital art “scarce” — by making one copy the ‘original copy’, allowing it to be sold like a traditional artwork would be at a far higher price than a normal digital image could be sold for. (The price of high-price traditional art is also a scam).</p>

              The purpose of cryptocurrencies is to make the financial system “fairer”, by ensuring that banks and governments do not control the currency or exert undue influence/corruption, etc. In order to explain why cryptocurrency do not solve this problem, we will look at some of their weaknesses.
